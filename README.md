# (Bayesian) RL as Probabilistic Inference

This is code that I've been developing that focuses on recent RL as inference methods in the literature (e.g. [Soft Actor-Critic](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05905) and the more recent [VAPOR-lite](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13294) algorithm. This repository is heavily inspired by the [Acme](https://github.com/google-deepmind/acme) repository from Google DeepMind. 

This is still a work in progress -- I will probably continue to develop this if I have the time.
